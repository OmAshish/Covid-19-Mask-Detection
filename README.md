# Covid-19-Mask-Detection 🤧

In this rise of covid 19, I have made a mask recognization for the security of people. I have even added the camera details for understanding a persomn's current location and the person's camera. The person's camera can be taken as a serial code in order to understand the place from which the image has been taken.

We should wear a mask in the rise of the of the covid-19.
